API provider notes:

For the dyn API, the username and password
are your dyn credentials.

For the he API, the username is the hostname,
and the password would be the dynamic dns
token in the dns record.

For the cloudflare API the username is not
used (but must be specified for compatibility),
and the password should be the API token.
